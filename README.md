# Learning the C Language
Repository of code that I wrote whilst learning the C language as part of the A Level Computer Science Course

### Highlights
- Implementation of Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort using just the standard libraries ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/Learning-C/blob/main/SortingAlgorithms/main.c))
- Circular Queue implementation ([file](https://github.com/BHASVIC-RobertSimmons23/Learning-C/blob/main/Chapter10CircularQueue/main.c))
